==  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS  ==


   ==<[ MacOS (10.4+/10.9) ]>==

	   . Download and install libraries from :
			  Qt (LGPL) : http://qt-project.org/downloads
	   		  Gecode 3.2.0 : http://www.gecode.org/download/Gecode-3.2.0.dmg
		  LibXml2 : http://www.explain.com.au/download/combo-2007-10-07.dmg.gz -> copy libxml.framework to /Library/Frameworks

	   . Get git repositories by downloading (or cloning) :
	   		  Score : https://github.com/OSSIA/Score

	   . Build Score, following the setps in the README.

	   . cd into i-score folder with your terminal.

	   . Compile by running the script : ./build.sh



   ==<[ Linux ]>==

		These explanations are for Debian and Debian-related (Mint, Ubuntu...) distributions.
		However, the only thing that might change would be the package manager (replace apt-get with yum on Fedora, etc...)

		. Install libraries and required tools from a package manager :
			# apt-get install libqt4-dev qt4-qmake libgl1-mesa-dev libgecode-dev libxml2-dev libsndfile-dev libportaudio-dev libportmidi-dev ruby git clang3.4

		. Build JamomaCore : https://github.com/jamoma/JamomaCore on the feature/linux branch
			% git clone https://github.com/jamoma/JamomaCore
			% git checkout feature/linux
			% ruby build.rb Development clean

			Jamoma shared libraries are installed in /usr/local/lib/jamoma/, so the root password will be asked.

		. Build Score : https://github.com/OSSIA/Score on branch feature/linux, by following the same steps than for Jamoma.

		. Build i-score :
		First set the path for i-score to find the jamoma includes
			% export JAMOMA_INCLUDE_PATH=(put here the path to the Jamoma/Core folder)

		Call qmake with a clang mkspec (the mkspec name might change with Qt versions)
			% qmake -spec unsupported/linux-clang

		Build :
			% make

		. Running (could be put in a shell script) :
			% export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib/jamoma/lib
			% ./i-score







   ==<[ Doxygen Documentation ]>==


In order to have documentation of the sources you have to install Doxygen (www.doxygen.org),
and the Graphviz package to generate graph with Doxygen (www.graphviz.org).
To generate documentation,
load ./doxygen/Doxyfile with Doxygen and run it.
