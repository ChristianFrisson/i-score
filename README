i-score is an interactive intermedia sequencer - read more at https://github.com/nicolashincker/i-score/wiki/What-is-i_score        

i-score currently builds only on MacOS - Linux builds have been achieved in a former version, but they have not been tested lately, so we don't guarantee that it will work 

in order to build i-score, follow the instructions in INSTALL.txt

no installer is available yet (planned for late december 2012)
